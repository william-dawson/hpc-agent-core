"""R-CCS Cloud registration — see PORTING.md.

The R-CCS Cloud is a Slurm cluster with accounting enabled (`sacct` works).
Its GPU dialect is the one combination that a single "style" enum can't
express and that hpc_agent_core.compute.slurm.SlurmBackend documents by
name:

- GPUs are requested with the job-total flag ``--gpus=<n>`` (gpu_request_style
  = "gpus_total"), but ...
- ``--nodes`` is **always emitted explicitly** (nodes_always_explicit=True) —
  Slurm here does not derive node placement from the GPU count, and ...
- the unified CPU+GPU superchip partitions (``qc-gh200`` and the ``ng-dgx-m*``
  family) take **no** GPU flag at all — the GPU is always present, so
  ``--gpus``/``--gres`` would be wrong to emit (no_gpu_flag_prefixes).

The one thing the generic backend cannot know is machine-specific: **every
R-CCS Cloud batch script must `source /etc/profile` before any `module`
command**, and the batch shebang is a non-login shell, so nothing sources it
for us. We subclass SlurmBackend to inject that one line right after the
`#SBATCH` header (PORTING.md: override the single method that differs,
reusing the base helpers). Everything else — submit, status parsing,
cancel, live resources — is the generic backend unchanged.

Unlike RIKYU, there's no single sensible default partition to fill in for a
blank queue_name (the whole point of this facility is choosing among CPU/
NVIDIA/AMD/Intel GPU partitions), so default_queue_name/validate_spec are
left at the base class's no-ops.
