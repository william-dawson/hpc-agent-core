# Configuring Miyabi (JCAHPC)

Settings live in `~/.hpc-agent/miyabi.json` (the common directory
shared by every facility this plugin serves — one file per facility). Env
vars `MIYABI_HOST` and `MIYABI_EMBED_API_KEY` override the
file; the embedding key also falls back to a shared `RCCS_EMBED_API_KEY`
env var if several facilities share the same endpoint.

The file this facility needs (add `"embedding": {"api_key": "..."}` too if
docs search should use vector rather than keyword matching):

```json
{
  "ssh": {
    "host": "miyabi-g"
  },
  "defaults": {
    "group": "<your-project-group>"
  }
}
```

## What must be true before it can connect

Miyabi asks for a one-time code at login, which non-interactive SSH
cannot answer. Use OpenSSH connection multiplexing: add a host block
to ~/.ssh/config with ControlMaster auto, ControlPath
~/.ssh/controlmasters/%C and ControlPersist 30m (mkdir -p that
directory, chmod 700), open the master once with `ssh -MNf <alias>`
entering your code, then set ssh.host to that SAME alias — a bare
hostname selects a different control socket and re-prompts.
Running on a Miyabi login node instead? Use ssh.host=localhost.
Set defaults.group to your own PBS project group: every job requires
#PBS -W group_list=<group>. Never copy a group from another user.
MIYABI_GROUP overrides the configured group.
If a call is suddenly refused with 'Permission denied
(keyboard-interactive)', the master connection expired — re-run
`ssh -MNf <alias>`. Never ask the user for their one-time code.

## Guided setup — interview the user, then write the file

Read the existing `~/.hpc-agent/miyabi.json` first and only ask
about what's missing or being changed.

1. **SSH** — ask how they reach this facility's login node:

   - **The recommended setup is a multiplexed SSH alias.** Miyabi asks for a
     one-time code at login, which a non-interactive SSH call can never
     answer — so the user authenticates once, interactively, and every later
     `ssh`/`rsync` reuses that connection.

     Have the user add a block to `~/.ssh/config` (substituting their
     account):

     ```
     Host miyabi-g
         HostName miyabi-g.jcahpc.jp
         User <account>
         ControlMaster auto
         ControlPath ~/.ssh/controlmasters/%C
         ControlPersist 30m
     ```

     then, after `mkdir -p ~/.ssh/controlmasters && chmod 700
     ~/.ssh/controlmasters`, open the master once:

     ```bash
     ssh -MNf miyabi-g       # they enter their one-time code here
     ssh -O check miyabi-g   # Master running (pid=…)
     ```

     Set `"host"` to that **same alias**. A bare hostname, or a different
     user or port, selects a different control socket and re-prompts.
   - **Running on a Miyabi login node instead?** Use `"host": "localhost"`,
     which is direct local execution and involves no SSH at all.

**Never ask the user for their one-time code, and never try to script or
automate entering one.** The whole arrangement depends on the code being
typed by the person, once, in their own terminal.

**Also set `defaults.group`** — every PBS job needs the user's own project
group (`#PBS -W group_list=<group>`), and `submit_job` refuses without one.
`MIYABI_GROUP` overrides the file. Never reuse a group from an example or
from another user; `id -Gn` on the login node shows theirs.

   - **Running the agent session directly on this facility's own
     front-end/login node** (not a personal laptop)? Use
     `"host": "localhost"` instead — no SSH key needed. Skip the
     verification step below for this case; there's nothing to probe.
   - Verify with: `ssh -o BatchMode=yes <host> 'echo ok'` (BatchMode
     matters — the server cannot answer a password prompt; key-based auth
     is required). Not applicable for `"host": "localhost"`.
2. **Embedding API key** (optional — skippable; BM25 keyword search still
   works without it). Store it under `embedding.api_key`.
3. **Write the file** to `~/.hpc-agent/miyabi.json` (`mkdir -p
   ~/.hpc-agent` first if needed), then `chmod 600` it — it may hold an API
   key. Never commit it or echo the key back in conversation.
4. **Validate**:
   ```bash
   uv tool run --quiet --from git+https://github.com/william-dawson/hpc-agent-core.git@unified-hub hpc-doctor miyabi
   ```
   (From a checkout of this repo: `.venv/bin/python -m hpc_mcp.doctor
   miyabi` also works.)
5. **If the embedding endpoint was added or changed**, rebuild this
   facility's docs index:
   ```bash
   uv tool run --quiet --from git+https://github.com/william-dawson/hpc-agent-core.git@unified-hub python -m hpc_mcp.ingest miyabi
   ```
   Then run the doctor again — it should report "chunks with embeddings".

## Notes

- Settings are read fresh on every tool call, so a config file edit
  (including switching `ssh.host` to/from `"localhost"`) applies
  immediately — no server restart needed. A rebuilt docs index still needs
  the `hpc-docs` server restarted to be picked up.
- Off-network or without a key, docs search transparently falls back to
  BM25 keyword search over the same content — the plugin still works.
