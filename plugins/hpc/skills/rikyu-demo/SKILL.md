# RIKYU (RIKEN AI4S / GB200) demo

Run each step in order — actually call the tools, don't just describe the
plan. Present results as a readable narrative, not raw JSON dumps. Use
markdown headers and tables to make it scannable. Pause after each step and
show the output before moving on. Every tool call uses `facility="rikyu"`.

## Step 1 — Confirm it's configured

Call `get_facility(facility="rikyu")` — it needs no SSH and returns this
machine's static facts, so a good result proves config parsing works.
Summarize the partitions, storage tiers, and modules.

Then call `get_projects(facility="rikyu")` to prove SSH is actually
reachable, and show which projects can be billed.

**If either call reports that the facility isn't configured, stop the demo
and switch to the `rikyu-configuring` skill.** The error itself contains
the full setup directions for this machine — walk the user through those
rather than continuing.

## Step 2 — Live cluster status

Call `get_resources(facility="rikyu")`. Show a table of partitions with
allocated/idle/total nodes, and point out where a job would start soonest.

## Step 3 — Documentation search

Call `search_docs(facility="rikyu", query="how do I submit a job")` on
the `hpc-docs` server. Show the top result and cite its section breadcrumb.

## Step 4 — Filesystem

Call `fs_ls(facility="rikyu", path=".")` to show the top of the user's
home directory on this machine.

## Step 5 — Recent jobs

Call `get_job_statuses(facility="rikyu", job_ids=[])` (an empty list
means "the last ~2 days"). If there are jobs, show them as a table: job ID,
name, state, partition, elapsed — and highlight any failed ones, offering to
investigate. If there are none, say so and move on.

## Step 6 — Submit a test job

Tell the user you'll submit a short test job to verify end-to-end
submission, then call `render_job_script(facility="rikyu", spec=...)` to
show exactly what will run, then `submit_job` with the same spec. Show the
returned job ID and script path. See the facility notes below for a spec
that suits this machine.

## Step 7 — Monitor and read the output

Poll `get_job_status(facility="rikyu", job_id=...)` every ~15 seconds —
use `run_command_on_cluster(facility="rikyu", command="sleep 15")` as the
wait, since there's no sleep tool. Stop when the state is terminal, or after
about five polls (tell the user to check back later if it's still queued).

Once it finishes, call
`read_job_output(facility="rikyu", job_id=...)` and show the output —
that tool finds the file itself, so you don't need to know the job's working
directory.

## Closing

Summarize in four bullets: configuration and facility checked, live status
seen, a job submitted and monitored, and its output retrieved. Then invite
the user to submit real work via `/rikyu-submitting-jobs`, monitor
existing jobs via `/rikyu-monitoring-jobs`, or ask about the machine via
`/rikyu-reference`.

## Facility notes for this demo

Use this spec for Step 6 — it proves the GPU allocation actually worked,
not just that a job ran:

```json
{
  "name": "rikyu-demo",
  "executable": "hostname && echo '---' && nvidia-smi --query-gpu=name,memory.total,driver_version --format=csv,noheader",
  "resources": {"gpus": 1, "processes_per_node": 1},
  "attributes": {"duration": 300, "queue_name": "gpu"}
}
```

When the output comes back, confirm the reported GPU model matches what
`get_facility` said — that's the check that makes this demo meaningful.

If the user belongs to several RIKYU projects, `submit_job` will be
rejected unless an account is set; `get_projects` in Step 1 already showed
which ones are available, so add `"account": "<project>"` to `attributes`.

Optional follow-up if the user wants to see containers: rerun the same
command inside Singularity by setting `container.image` — the GPU
passthrough flag (`--nv`) is added automatically when the job requests GPUs.
