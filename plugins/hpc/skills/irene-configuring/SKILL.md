# Configuring Irene (CEA TGCC)

Settings live in `~/.hpc-agent/irene.json` (the common directory
shared by every facility this plugin serves — one file per facility). Env
vars `IRENE_HOST` and `IRENE_EMBED_API_KEY` override the
file; the embedding key also falls back to a shared `RCCS_EMBED_API_KEY`
env var if several facilities share the same endpoint.

The file this facility needs (add `"embedding": {"api_key": "..."}` too if
docs search should use vector rather than keyword matching):

```json
{
  "ssh": {
    "host": "irene"
  },
  "computer": {
    "passfile": "/path/to/local/password-file-if-needed"
  },
  "defaults": {
    "account": "<your-TGCC-project>",
    "filesystems": "scratch,work"
  }
}
```

## What must be true before it can connect

Use the Irene SSH destination issued in your TGCC project
documentation; no public hostname is assumed here. Prefer an
existing 'irene' alias in ~/.ssh/config, or set ssh.host to the
issued user@host. If the account needs password-file authentication,
put that local path under computer.passfile (not ssh.passfile).
Set defaults.account only to a project returned by get_projects;
Bridge checks that project against the requested partition before
submitting. defaults.filesystems supplies mandatory #MSUB -m and
normally starts as scratch,work. IRENE_ACCOUNT and
IRENE_FILESYSTEMS override those values. Use host=localhost when
already running on an Irene front end.

## Guided setup — interview the user, then write the file

Read the existing `~/.hpc-agent/irene.json` first and only ask
about what's missing or being changed.

1. **SSH** — ask how they reach this facility's login node:

Use the Irene SSH destination from the user's TGCC project documentation;
prefer an existing `irene` alias or the issued user@host. If authentication
needs a password file, configure it as `computer.passfile`, not
`ssh.passfile`. Use `host=localhost` only when the agent is already on an Irene
front end.

Set `defaults.account` only after `get_projects(facility="irene")` has shown
the user's real TGCC project, and set `defaults.filesystems` to the normal
Bridge `-m` list (`scratch,work` for ordinary jobs). `IRENE_ACCOUNT` and
`IRENE_FILESYSTEMS` override the file. Docs search is BM25-only because no
shared Irene embedding endpoint is verified.

   - **Running the agent session directly on this facility's own
     front-end/login node** (not a personal laptop)? Use
     `"host": "localhost"` instead — no SSH key needed. Skip the
     verification step below for this case; there's nothing to probe.
   - Verify with: `ssh -o BatchMode=yes <host> 'echo ok'` (BatchMode
     matters — the server cannot answer a password prompt; key-based auth
     is required). Not applicable for `"host": "localhost"`.
2. **Embedding API key** (optional — skippable; BM25 keyword search still
   works without it). Store it under `embedding.api_key`.
3. **Write the file** to `~/.hpc-agent/irene.json` (`mkdir -p
   ~/.hpc-agent` first if needed), then `chmod 600` it — it may hold an API
   key. Never commit it or echo the key back in conversation.
4. **Validate**:
   ```bash
   uv tool run --quiet --from git+https://github.com/william-dawson/hpc-agent-core.git@unified-hub hpc-doctor irene
   ```
   (From a checkout of this repo: `.venv/bin/python -m hpc_mcp.doctor
   irene` also works.)
5. **If the embedding endpoint was added or changed**, rebuild this
   facility's docs index:
   ```bash
   uv tool run --quiet --from git+https://github.com/william-dawson/hpc-agent-core.git@unified-hub python -m hpc_mcp.ingest irene
   ```
   Then run the doctor again — it should report "chunks with embeddings".

## Notes

- Settings are read fresh on every tool call, so a config file edit
  (including switching `ssh.host` to/from `"localhost"`) applies
  immediately — no server restart needed. A rebuilt docs index still needs
  the `hpc-docs` server restarted to be picked up.
- Off-network or without a key, docs search transparently falls back to
  BM25 keyword search over the same content — the plugin still works.
