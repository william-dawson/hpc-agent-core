description: Use when the user asks about the status, progress, output, history, or failure of jobs on Fugaku, or about queue and node availability. Also use this any time you (the agent) need to check on or wait for a job you submitted, even without a fresh user request.

# Monitoring jobs on Fugaku

Every tool call in this skill uses `facility="fugaku"`.

## Status checks (same tools and semantics everywhere)

Use these tools even when you're checking in on your own initiative — don't
fall back to `run_command_on_cluster` with raw `squeue`/`sacct` just
because there's no new user message prompting it; the tools below return
the same information normalized, plus any facility-specific lag/quirk
handling noted below.

- **One job**: `get_job_status(facility="fugaku", job_id=...)` — `state`
  is normalized (`queued`/`active`/`completed`/`failed`/`canceled`/`held`/
  `unknown`); `meta_data.native_state` is the scheduler's own. A queued
  job's `message` explains the wait.
- **My recent jobs**: `get_job_statuses(facility="fugaku", job_ids=[])`
  for roughly the last two days, or pass specific IDs.
- **Cluster availability**: `get_resources(facility="fugaku")` —
  per-partition allocated/idle/other/total node counts. Idle nodes can
  start jobs immediately.
- **Reading a job's output**: the file is `slurm-<job_id>.out` inside the
  directory the job ran in. **Get that directory from the job's own status
  record** (`meta_data.workdir`) rather than assuming `$HOME` — a job whose
  spec set `directory` writes its output there, not in the home directory.
  Then read it with `fs_tail(facility="fugaku", path=...)` for a running
  job, or `fs_view` once it has finished.

## PJM state codes

`ACC`/`QUE` → queued · `HLD`/`SPD`/`SPP` → held ·
`RNP`/`RUN`/`RNA`/`RNE`/`RNO`/`RSM` → active · `EXT` → completed ·
`CCL` → canceled · `ERR`/`RJT` → failed. The raw code is in
`meta_data.native_state`.

## "completed" does not mean "succeeded"

**`EXT` only means the scheduler finished with the job** — PJM's live
status table has no exit-code column at all, so a failed program still
shows as `completed`. **Always read the job's output before telling the
user it worked.**

## Finding the output — two places, and the obvious one is often empty

PJM writes `<name>.<job_id>.out`/`.err` into the *submission* directory
(`~/agent/jobs/` by default). But **Fujitsu MPI intercepts per-rank stdout
and writes it somewhere else entirely**:
`output.<jobid>/<rank_path>/stdout.<step>.<rank>` inside the job's working
directory. The PJM `.out` file is then often empty or holds only the
scheduler wrapper.

So for an MPI job, find the real output with:

```sh
find . -path "*output.<jobid>*" -name "stdout*" | sort
```

(`$PJM_JOBID` holds the current job ID inside a running job.) Run that via
`run_command_on_cluster(facility="fugaku", ...)`, then read what it finds
with `fs_view`/`fs_tail`.

## `ERR` before the job ever starts

A job that goes to `ERR` with **no output file and no start date** was
rejected by the pre-execution gate check, not by your program. Get the
reason with:

```
pjstat -s <job_id>
```

and read its `REASON` line. The known cause of `GATE CHECK` here is a
comma-separated `PJM_LLIO_GFSCACHE` value — see
`fugaku-submitting-jobs`; `submit_job` now rejects that before
submitting. Note `RESOURCE GROUP` may show a sub-group like `small-s5`
rather than the `small` you asked for; that is normal and **not** a
problem — healthy jobs run in it too. `pjstat --history` returns nothing
on this deployment, so `pjstat -s` is the only tool that answers this.

## Quotas and limits

- `run_command_on_cluster(facility="fugaku", command="pjstat --limit")` —
  concurrent-job and node/core quotas.
- `run_command_on_cluster(facility="fugaku", command="pjacl --rg <name>")` —
  a resource group's node/elapse limits **for this account**, which is what
  actually governs whether a submission is accepted.

## get_resources is best-effort text here

It returns raw `pjstat --rsc`/`pjshowrsc` output. Those commands did not
return usable per-partition occupancy during this port's live testing, so
treat it as text, not structured data — the resource-group node/time limits
in `get_facility` are the more reliable static reference.

## Changing a queued job

`update_job` can only change the elapse limit (via `pjalter`), and only
while the job is still queued or held. Everything else — resource group,
node count, project group — means cancel and resubmit.

## Cancelling and updating

- `cancel_job(facility="fugaku", job_id=...)` — **confirm with the user
  before calling this.**
- `update_job(facility="fugaku", job_id=..., spec={...})` — pass a
  JobSpec containing only what should change, e.g.
  `{"attributes": {"duration": "02:00:00"}}`. Only fields a scheduler can
  change after submission are applied (job name, wall time, partition,
  account, reservation, node count); anything else you set is reported back
  as not applied. Only affects jobs still queued or running.

## Polling until done, from a notebook

Interactively, just call `get_job_status` again after a pause. If you're
writing a reproducible notebook instead (see `fugaku-reproducing`), use
`hpc_agent_core.client`'s `wait_for_job(job_id, facility="fugaku")`
rather than a hand-rolled polling loop.

Don't guess facility-specific failure modes beyond what's noted above — use
`search_docs(facility="fugaku", query=...)` on the `hpc-docs` server.
