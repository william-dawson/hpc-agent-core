# Configuring RIKYU (RIKEN AI4S / GB200)

Settings live in `~/.hpc-agent/rikyu.json` (the common directory
shared by every facility this plugin serves — one file per facility). Env
vars `RIKYU_HOST` and `RIKYU_EMBED_API_KEY` override the
file; the embedding key also falls back to a shared `RCCS_EMBED_API_KEY`
env var if several facilities share the same endpoint.

The file this facility needs (add `"embedding": {"api_key": "..."}` too if
docs search should use vector rather than keyword matching):

```json
{
  "ssh": {
    "host": "rikyu"
  }
}
```

## What must be true before it can connect

RIKYU accepts key-based SSH only. Generate a key if you don't have
one (Ed25519 recommended; ECDSA P-521 or RSA >=2048 also accepted)
and register the public key through RIKYU's Open OnDemand web portal
on its 'SSH Public Key' page before the first login. Then add a
'rikyu' alias to ~/.ssh/config pointing at
login.rikyu.r-ccs.riken.jp, or set ssh.host to
user@login.rikyu.r-ccs.riken.jp.
If you belong to more than one RIKYU project, also add
"defaults": {"account": "<project>"} — otherwise sbatch rejects
jobs that don't name one. get_projects lists the projects you can
charge once the connection works.
Running on a RIKYU front-end node instead of a laptop? Use
"host": "localhost" and no SSH key is needed at all.

## Guided setup — interview the user, then write the file

Read the existing `~/.hpc-agent/rikyu.json` first and only ask
about what's missing or being changed.

1. **SSH** — ask how they reach this facility's login node:

   - An alias in `~/.ssh/config` (recommended) → `"host": "<alias>"`.
   - If the key isn't registered yet, they'll need to generate one (Ed25519
     recommended; ECDSA P-521 or RSA ≥2048-bit also accepted) and register
     the public key through RIKYU's Open OnDemand web portal ("SSH Public
     Key" page) before the first login — point them to that portal by
     name, not a URL, since it isn't one we should be linking to here.

   - **Running the agent session directly on this facility's own
     front-end/login node** (not a personal laptop)? Use
     `"host": "localhost"` instead — no SSH key needed. Skip the
     verification step below for this case; there's nothing to probe.
   - Verify with: `ssh -o BatchMode=yes <host> 'echo ok'` (BatchMode
     matters — the server cannot answer a password prompt; key-based auth
     is required). Not applicable for `"host": "localhost"`.
   - **Enable SSH multiplexing unless the user explicitly opts out.** This
     lets repeated agent operations reuse one authenticated connection rather
     than making the login node authenticate every call. Recommend an SSH
     alias and, after showing the exact change and receiving confirmation,
     add a narrowly scoped block to `~/.ssh/config` without overwriting any
     unrelated entries:
     ```sshconfig
     Host <alias>
       ControlMaster auto
       ControlPath ~/.ssh/controlmasters/%C
       ControlPersist 30m
     ```
     Create `~/.ssh/controlmasters` with mode `0700`, then open the initial
     master in the user's own terminal with `ssh -MNf <alias>`. Set
     `ssh.host` to that same alias. `ControlMaster no` is an intentional
     opt-out; do not add or change multiplexing settings when it is present.
2. **Embedding API key** (optional — skippable; BM25 keyword search still
   works without it). Store it under `embedding.api_key`.
3. **Write the file** to `~/.hpc-agent/rikyu.json` (`mkdir -p
   ~/.hpc-agent` first if needed), then `chmod 600` it — it may hold an API
   key. Never commit it or echo the key back in conversation.
4. **Validate**:
   ```bash
   uv tool run --quiet --from git+https://github.com/william-dawson/hpc-agent-core.git@unified-hub hpc-doctor rikyu
   ```
   (From a checkout of this repo: `.venv/bin/python -m hpc_mcp.doctor
   rikyu` also works.)
5. **If the embedding endpoint was added or changed**, rebuild this
   facility's docs index:
   ```bash
   uv tool run --quiet --from git+https://github.com/william-dawson/hpc-agent-core.git@unified-hub python -m hpc_mcp.ingest rikyu
   ```
   Then run the doctor again — it should report "chunks with embeddings".

## Notes

- Settings are read fresh on every tool call, so a config file edit
  (including switching `ssh.host` to/from `"localhost"`) applies
  immediately — no server restart needed. A rebuilt docs index still needs
  the `hpc-docs` server restarted to be picked up.
- Off-network or without a key, docs search transparently falls back to
  BM25 keyword search over the same content — the plugin still works.
