"""Generic MCP tools for searching a facility's bundled documentation guide.

Read-only and needs no SSH access. Uses the pre-built packaged index at
config.docs_index_dir(facility) (chunks.json + optional embeddings.npy);
queries are embedded against that facility's configured serving
infrastructure when available, with automatic fallback to keyword search.

Per PORTING.md, a chunk only carries a "Source: ..." line when the facility
registered a docs_cite_url — most facilities leave it blank (no live site
worth citing), in which case results never mention a URL at all. This is a
deliberate per-facility policy, not a bug: don't add a URL back in here
without checking config.docs_cite_url(facility) first.

server/hpc_mcp/docs_server.py imports every facilities/*/facility.py (to
register them), constructs MCPServer("hpc-docs"), and calls build(mcp) below
before serve(mcp) — one process, every facility.

        facility must be one of the slugs returned by get_facilities() (on
        the hpc-mcp server) — call that first if you don't already know
        which facility you're working with.

        Always call this first before answering any facility-specific
        question — job submission, modules, storage, login procedure, or
        any other cluster-specific detail. Do not rely on prior knowledge or
        the orientation facts embedded in skills — those are fallback aids,
        not authoritative.

        If a result carries no "Source:" line, that's deliberate (see this
        module's docstring) — do not invent or guess a URL to send the user
        to.

        If this tool errors or returns no results, fall back to the inline
        facts in the active skill and note that docs were unavailable.

        When results begin with `[search_method: bm25]`, inform the user
        that keyword search was used because the embedding server could not
        be reached. Results may miss semantically relevant sections that
        don't share exact keywords with the query.
