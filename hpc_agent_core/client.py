"""Public, script/notebook-facing MCP client for the HPC agent family.

Unlike `hpc_agent_core.testing` (asserts, pass/fail tiers — for
`tests/smoke.py` only), everything here is meant to be imported directly by
code that wants to drive a machine's tool surface *without* an interactive
agent session behind it: a notebook distilling exploratory agent work into a
reproducible narrative, a one-off script, CI.

`connect()` opens an MCP stdio session against a machine's `hpc_server` (or
`docs_server`) executable — either a dev-mode `python -m` invocation
(`dev_params`) or the same pinned `uv tool run --from git+...@<ref>`
invocation a plugin's own `.mcp.json` uses (`pinned_params`), pinning a tag
or commit rather than `main` for reproducibility across time — and hands
back an `HpcClient` that exposes every registered tool as a plain async
method (`await hpc.submit_job(spec)` instead of
`payload(await call(session, "submit_job", {...}))`).

Optional on-disk caching (`mode="lazy"` / `"replay"`) lets a notebook be
re-run without re-hitting the cluster: results are cached per (tool name,
canonicalized args). `wait_for_job` is special-cased — polling calls the
same status tool with the same job_id and gets *different* answers over
time on purpose, so only its terminal result is ever cached, never an
intermediate poll (see its docstring for why a generic per-call cache would
get this wrong).

`connect()` is async (`async with connect(...) as hpc: await hpc.submit_job(...)`).
Most of the time `connect_sync()` is what you actually want in a notebook or
script: same `HpcClient` underneath, but every call blocks instead of needing
`await`, and there's no `async with`/`__aenter__` ceremony spread across
cells — `hpc = connect_sync(...)`, `hpc.submit_job(...)`, `hpc.close()`.

Three modes, set once on `connect()`/`connect_sync()`:
  - "live":   always call the real server; still writes to the cache as a
              side effect, so a live run recharges it for next time.
  - "lazy":   use the cache if present, else fall back to live and cache
              the result. The default — good for iterating on a notebook's
              later cells without resubmitting jobs on every "run all".
  - "replay": cache-only, raises CacheMiss on anything not already
              recorded. No SSH is attempted at all. This is the mode to
              hand a notebook to someone with no cluster account: "run
              all" reproduces the recorded narrative in seconds, offline.

A cache-backed "lazy" run is not proof a notebook still reproduces
end-to-end — a stale cache happily papers over a since-broken call. Run
"live" at least once before trusting a notebook as a validated artifact,
the same way a machine repo's read-only/job smoke tiers (not just its
offline tier) are what actually prove a port works end to end — see
PORTING.md §9.
